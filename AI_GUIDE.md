# AI Guide for New Tab Dashboard

This document provides guidance for AI assistants working with this new tab dashboard project.

## Project Overview
This is a single-page HTML application designed to be used as a browser's new tab page. It displays GitHub pull request information in a clean, dark-themed interface.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Files
- `new_tab_dash.html`: The main application file containing all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- `README.md`: User documentation and setup instructions

### 2. Main Features
- Dark theme with modern design
- GitHub PR review request display
- Personal open PR display
- Secure token management
- Real-time updates
- Responsive layout

### 3. Technical Implementation
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation
- Uses localStorage for token storage
- GitHub API integration
- No external dependencies
- Single-file architecture

## AI Development Guidelines

### 1. Code Structure
- All code is contained in a single HTML file
- CSS is in the `<style>` section
- JavaScript is in the `<script>` section
- Follow the existing code organization pattern

### 2. Security Considerations
- Never expose full GitHub tokens
- Always use secure token handling methods
- Maintain existing security measures
- Keep token storage in localStorage

### 3. UI/UX Guidelines
- Maintain dark theme (#000000 background)
- Use consistent color scheme
- Keep clean, minimal design
- Ensure responsive layout
- Follow existing component styling

### 4. Feature Development
When adding new features:
1. Keep the single-file architecture
2. Maintain existing security measures
3. Follow the established UI patterns
4. Ensure mobile responsiveness
5. Add appropriate error handling

### 5. Common Tasks
- Token management
- GitHub API integration
- UI updates
- Error handling
- Performance optimization

### 6. Testing Guidelines
- Test in multiple browsers
- Verify token security
- Check responsive design
- Validate API calls
- Test error scenarios

## Best Practices
1. Keep the single-file architecture
2. Maintain existing security measures
3. Follow established UI patterns
4. Document any new features
5. Test thoroughly before suggesting changes

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Breaking the single-file structure
2. Compromising security measures
3. Deviating from the dark theme
4. Adding unnecessary dependencies
5. Overcomplicating the UI

## Future Development Suggestions
1. Add more GitHub metrics
2. Implement customizable themes
3. Add more organization features
4. Enhance error handling
5. Improve performance
